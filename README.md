> Spring '23

**Course Overview:** This course offers an introduction to computer
vision and computational photography. The course will cover basic
principles of image processing, image recognition using both classical
methods and deep learning, and multiple view geometry for visual
navigation. It will explore the topics of image formation, image
features, image stitching, image segmentation, motion estimation,
tracking, and object and scene recognition.

> The course is organized around several projects. Through these
> projects you will learn the theory and practical skills required to
> obtain a computer vision engineering job.

**Text:** All concepts will be covered during in-class lecture. However,
we also recommend the following books as good references:

> •Richard Szeliski, *Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications*,
> Springer, 2010 online version.
>
> •D. Forsythe and J. Ponce, *Computer Vision: A Modern Approach*,
> Prentice-Hall, 2003 (available online).
>
> •Rafael Gonzalez, and Richard Woods, *Digital Image Processing*,
> Prentice Hall, 2008.
>
> •Richard Hartley, and Andrew Zisserman, *Multiple View Geometry in
> Computer Vision*, Cambridge University Press, 2008.

**Prerequisites:** Each student is expected to know the basic concepts
of Python programming, linear algebra and multivariable calculus.

**Course Work and Exams:** Course work will consist of individual
homework assignments, several group-based programming projects, and a
final project. For the homework assignments, you may discuss problems
and general solution strategies with classmates, but you *must* write up
the solutions yourself. We will be using the Python programming language
for this course.

> Assignments will be turned in on ELMS, https://www.elms.umd.edu.
>
> All work must be typed in LaTeX, not handwritten. Poorly written work
> will not be graded. When writing programming assignments be sure not
> only that your solution is correct, but also that it is easy for the
> grader to understand why your solution is correct.
>
> Do not post any of your project/homework code publicly online (e.g.,
> github public repository). Doing so is a violation of academic
> integrity policy.

**Late Policy**: Assignments turned in late will incur a 15% penalty per
day for up to 7 days. An assignment submitted 1 second after the
deadline will count as one day late. We will be ruthless in enforcing
this policy. Assignments turned in late because of excused and
documented absences (e.g., COVID) will be accepted penalty-free for up
to 7 days. Assignments will not be accepted more than 7 days late.

**Final Project:** The final project will be due on Monday, May 16 at
1:30 PM (ET).

**Piazza:** We will be using Piazza (www.piazza.com), a
question-and-answer system designed to streamline discussion outside of
the classroom. It supports LaTeX, code formatting, embedding of images,
and attaching of files. It will be moderated by the instructor and TAs,
but students are encouraged to answer questions and will receive
(limited) extra credit for doing so. All posts will be public so that
everyone can benefit from question answers and so that TAs aren't
answering the same question many times. Do not post code or answers to
Piazza.

**ELMS:** We will be using ELMS to view lecture slides, hand in
assignments, and to see grades.

**Grading:** Final grades will be based on individual homework
assignments (25%), a one-week take-home "midterm" (10%), group-based
programming assignments (40%), and the individual final project (25%).
We aim to have a standard 90/80/70/... breakdown for letter grades, but
reserve the right to curve up.

**Disability Support Services:** Any student eligible for and requesting
reasonable academic accommodations due to a disability is requested to
provide, to the instructor via email, a letter of accommodation from the
Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) within the first two weeks
of the semester.

**Religious Holidays:** If you observe any religious holidays that
conflict with the course schedule please let the instructor know during
the first two weeks of the semester so that accommodations can be made.

**Course Evaluations:** The Department of Computer Science takes the
student course evaluations very seriously. Evaluations will usually be
open during the last few weeks of the course. Students can go to
www.courseevalum.umd.edu to complete their evaluations.

**Copyright:** Students are permitted to use course materials for their
own personal use only. Course materials may not be distributed publicly
or provided to others (except other students in the course), in any way
or format.

**Class Concerns:** If you have any class concerns, feel free to contact
the instructor. If an issue arises with the instructor, report it using
the form available at

**Syllabus:** This is the current version of the syllabus. The
instructors reserve the right to change it at any time.
